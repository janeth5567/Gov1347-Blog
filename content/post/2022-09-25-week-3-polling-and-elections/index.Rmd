**Building Our Predictive Model So Far**

To clarify from my previous posts where I didn't clearly have a section of my model and its predictions formally, I will do that now. I have decided to look at the Democratic seat number as the dependent variable for my model. My previous model combined economy data which I chose to be GDP, disposable income, and unemployment. With this model in my previous post, the R-squared is 0.22. This is relatively good, considering that 20% of the variance can be explained by these trends.However, the residual standard error is 28.94 on 27 degrees of freedom. Below is my a graph of my model that includes my observed vs predicted values. 

```{r}

PredictiveModel <- lm(D_seats ~  GDP_growth_qt + DSPIC_change_qt + UNRATE, data = economy_model_data)

coefficients(PredictiveModel)

summary(PredictiveModel)

National_prediction <- data.frame()

data_mod <- data.frame(Predicted = predict(PredictiveModel, new_data = National_prediction),  # Create data for ggplot2 
                       Observed = economy_model_data$D_seats)

ggplot(data_mod,                                  
       aes(x = Predicted,
           y = Observed)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_abline(intercept = 0,
              slope = 1,
              color = "red",
              size = 2) +
 geom_label(label= economy_model_data$year, nudge_y = 5) + theme_janet() + ggtitle("Predictive Model 1:\nPredicted v. Observed Democrat Seats")


```
